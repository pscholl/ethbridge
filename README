= ethbridge - jennic based Ieee802.15.4 USB Stick =

 This is a Contiki-based firmware for the jnusb platform, supplying ethernet
emulated access to an Ieee802.15.4 Network. The firmware is based on the same
code that is used on the Atmel AVR raven usb stick. The hardware is available to
the public at platform/jnusb/ in the contiki source tree.

== Building ==

 Adapt the Makefile with the location of your Contiki Source Tree, i.e. change
the Contiki = ../contiki line to suit your environment. Then use

 $ make TARGET=jnusb ethbridge.jnusb.hex

 to get the .hex file that needs to be uploaded to your jnusb stick. You can use
the jenprog (http://www.teco.edu/~scholl/ba-toolchain/jenprog-1.1.tar.gz)
utility for that.

== Usage ==

 After programming plug the stick into your computer. A CDC Ethernet Device
should pop up on your pc. On Linux this will just be another ethX interface that
you can pull up (e.g. ifconfig eth1 up) and start to receive Ipv6 packets.

 Per default the USB Stick is configured to start as a Coordinator and start a
Network with the Panid 0xbeef on the most silent channel in non-beacon mode. To
change that behaviour you need to modify the Makefile or contiki-conf.h file in
platform/jnusb in the contiki directory:

  - fixed channel operation in contiki-conf.h
  - beacon-enabled mode in contiki-conf.h
  - panid in contiki-conf.h
  - to start as a normal node and join the configured panid network change the
    Makefile to exclude the -DJENNIC_CONF_COORDINATOR and make sure its not
    defined elsewhere

= slipbridge - jennic based ieee802.15.4 uart networking =

 A firmware compatible with the tapslip6 bridge found in the contiki
distribution under tools/tapslip6.c (with minor changes, make sure to use the
jennic contiki branch).

== Building == 

 Again, adapt the Makefile.slipbridge with the location of the jennic contiki
branch. Choose a platform (this examples uses jndevkit). Then type

 $ make TARGET=jndevkit -f Makefile.slipbridge slipbridge.u

with the jennic jndevkit connected and in programming mode (holding SPIMISO
while releasing RESET).

== Usage ==

 Make sure the firmware is running (by pressing reset after programming) and
that the jennic module has a proper mac address set. If there is no proper mac
address (first byte of the address must be zero!) the bridge won't function
properly. Change into contiki/tools/. Build the tapslip6 binary if you haven't
done so already:

 $ make tapslip6

and run with:

 $ sudo ./tapslip6 -B 115200 -s /dev/ttyUSB0 127.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
slip started on ``/dev/ttyUSB0''
opened device ``/dev/tap0''
